# Support

The quickest way to get support is often to come and chat to us on our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/W7NCEYnEfy) although you can [email us directly](mailto:contact@openblocks.app)&#x20;

We are also active on social media - primarily on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/openblocks.app) (we are winding down our [Twitter presence](https://twitter.com/openblocksapp) but the account is still active during the transition. We also have accounts on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/openblocksapp/) and [Threads](https://www.threads.net/@openblocksapp) - and we'll hopefully soon be more active on Tiktok, Mastodon and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/openblocks/)\

For more technical issues - especially those related to the code or integrating your software with Open Blocks then we have a [Github Issue Tracker](https://github.com/icosa-foundation/open-blocks/issues)
